# LevelsOfProduct
Code to recurse through a list of items (products) each of which can refer to 0 or more other (products) and report the:

* depth of the tree of items associated with a particular product;
* rolled up cost of a product

The list of products is a CSV file of records, one for each product - dependent product relationship. The CSV is likely to come from Business Central, and
an example is part of the repository.  Report files generated by the script are also included in the repository.
